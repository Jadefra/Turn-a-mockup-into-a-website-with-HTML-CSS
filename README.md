# Turn a mockup into a website with HTML & CSS

I was in charge of creating this prototype by integrating the model in HTML and CSS.

The website is responsive (adapts to phone screens)

### Functional Specifications : ###
- Users will be able to search for accommodation in the city of their choice. The search field is an input field, so the text should be able to be edited by the user. This field is in a form for it to be valid with the W3C. The search part does not work at the moment.
- Each accommodation or activity card is clickable in its entirety (not just the title). For now, the links are empty. We used an attribute `href=”#”` to simulate the presence of a link.
- Filters change appearance on hover.
- The texts “Accommodations” and “Activities”, located in the header, are links. They lead respectively to the “Accommodation in Marseille” and “Activities in Marseille” sections.

### Technical specifications : ###
- The site is also suitable for tablet formats. For the tablets, I was free to make the necessary adaptations. No element is cut, and the text has a sufficient size.
- Regarding breakpoints, we agreed with the client to use 992 px and 768 px.
992px for computer screens and 768px for tablets, and anything below 768 for mobile phones.
- The use of Media Queries will allow us to realize
integration for different media.
- The icons are from the Font Awesome library. We went through a CDN to make it easier to load the icons.
- Chart colors are blue (#0065FC), a lighter version clear of this blue (#DEEBFF) and gray for the background (#F2F2F2).
- The site font is Raleway.
- Use of pixels and percentages rather than REM and EM.
- Using Flexbox rather than Grid.
- No CSS framework (BootStrap or Tailwind CSS type) or CSS preprocessor (Sass or Less type) was used.
- Use of semantic tags (type `main`,`header`, `nav`, etc.).
- The code is valid for W3C HTML and CSS validators.
- The mockup is compatible with the latest versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
- The code complies with W3C validators (HTML and CSS).
